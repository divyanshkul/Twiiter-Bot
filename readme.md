# Auto Tweeting Bot

This is a auto tweeting bot based on the ruby twitter gem. Made for GCI 2017 Task.

## Features 

* The user can enter a time delay between each tweet.
* There are two modes for the bot:
	1. **The Manual mode**: The user has to provide his text for tweet and delay between each tweet successively.
	2. **The Auto mode**: The user can enter any number of tweet in a json file called ```tweetData.json``` and a time between each (right now the time is applied to each tweet, **to be updated**)

## To-Do
1. Make a GUI based application around this basic structure.
